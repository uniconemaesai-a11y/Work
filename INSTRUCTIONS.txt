HOW TO DEPLOY AS A GOOGLE APPS SCRIPT WEB APP:

1. Go to https://script.google.com and create a new project.
2. Replace the contents of "Code.gs" with the provided Code.gs code.
3. In the Apps Script project, create a new HTML file named "index.html" and paste the contents of the generated index.html.
4. (Since this is a React SPA) You will need to bundle the React code or use a build tool like 'clasp' to push the compiled assets.
   - For a quick manual test: You can place the React component logic inside a <script type="text/babel"> tag in index.html, but for production, it's best to host the compiled JS.
   - ALTERNATIVELY, if you are using this code block directly in a developer environment that handles the React compilation, it will generate the necessary artifacts.

5. IMPORTANT CONFIGURATION:
   - Create a Folder in your Google Drive to store videos. Copy its ID (the string after /folders/ in the URL).
   - Create a Google Sheet to store logs. Copy its ID (the string after /d/ in the URL).
   - Update the `CONFIG` object at the top of `Code.gs` with these IDs.

6. DEPLOY:
   - Click "Deploy" > "New Deployment".
   - Select "Web App".
   - Set "Execute as" to "Me" (your account).
   - Set "Who has access" to "Anyone" (so students don't need to log into a Google Workspace account, or "Anyone with a Google Account" for more security).
   - Click "Deploy".

7. AUTHORIZATION:
   - Grant the necessary permissions (Drive and Sheets access) when prompted.

8. TESTING:
   - Copy the "Web App URL" provided and send it to your students!

DESIGN NOTES:
- The UI uses Fredoka One and Quicksand fonts for a rounded, friendly feel.
- Colors are soft pastels (Blue-50, Pink-50, etc.) with bold primary action colors.
- Confetti.js is used for a celebration effect on success.
